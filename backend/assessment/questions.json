		"question": "Do you require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users?",
		"type": "boolean",
		"options": ["Yes", "No"],
		"explanation": "MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is an extra layer of security that asks for more than just a password when logging in. Most people know it as a code sent via SMS, but it can also be an app notification, fingerprint, or security key. This helps protect your account by making sure only you can access it, even if someone else knows your password.",

		"explanation": "Do you keep track of who can access what? Just like a guest list for an event, your company should have a list of employees and what systems or data they can use. This helps make sure that when someone leaves or changes jobs, they don’t keep access to things they shouldn’t.",
